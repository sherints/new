<h3>Description</h3>
<p> The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish make a delicious flavor combination.
     Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3><ul>
<li>Potatoes: This recipe starts with thinly sliced Russet potatoes. You can substitute Yukon gold, if you like.</li>
<li>Onion: Slice one onion into rings to layer with the potatoes.</li>
<li>Seasonings: These creamy au gratin potatoes are simply seasoned with just salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Butter and flour: The cheese sauce starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.</li>
<li>Milk: Make sure you slowly whisk in the milk to create the creamiest consistency.</li>
<li>Cheese: Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Assemble the casserole:</b> Layer half of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Season. Layer onion slices over top, then top with remaining potatoes. Season again.</li>
<li><b>Make the sauce:</b> Melt the butter in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook for about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the cheese.</li>
<li><b>Bake the casserole:</b>Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
