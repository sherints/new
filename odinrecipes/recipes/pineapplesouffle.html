<li>½ cup milk</li>

<li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>

    <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.</li>

    <li>Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in a large bowl. Stir in the pineapple and bread. Lightly fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread the mixture into a large baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
